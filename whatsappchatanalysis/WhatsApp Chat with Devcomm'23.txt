24/09/2023, 18:37 - +91 87449 20043: Suppose if you want to access Matrix or equation in calculator your type menu followed by 4 or A respectively but in cw i have to navigate through navigation buttons. Also in you got value in constant like pi  if applicable in calculation but in cw you get decimal value, you have to interpreted yourself. etc.
You much watch comparison video prior to buying calculator because you have to use for your entire journey of engineering. <This message was edited>

28/09/2023, 11:34 - +91 88829 29741: bro this is the first time community service is introduced.
28/09/2023, 11:34 - +91 88606 50921: I think NSS was already introduced.
28/09/2023, 11:35 - +91 88606 50921: But don't know about dkm, cw
28/09/2023, 11:35 - +91 88829 29741: NSS is more like society
28/09/2023, 11:35 - +91 88829 29741: Community service is subject
28/09/2023, 11:35 - +91 98185 53635: I think he means ki compulsory issi saal se hua hai

28/09/2023, 11:38 - +91 88829 29741: depends on what your priority is
28/09/2023, 11:39 - +91 95409 04312: It would be tough to manage both as there are many other societies as well.
28/09/2023, 11:40 - +91 95409 04312: Priority in what sense?
28/09/2023, 11:40 - +91 83750 39642: Interest ke hisab se join kr lo

28/09/2023, 11:41 - +91 95409 04312: Interest is in NSS. Bas day scholar ke hisaab se time issue hai thoda kyuki travel time bohot hai.
28/09/2023, 11:41 - +91 88829 29741: Like do you really want to do NSS or do you think DKM is better because its less time consuming
28/09/2023, 11:42 - +91 95409 04312: I really want to do NSS. My second choice is DKM only because of travel time issues.
28/09/2023, 11:42 - +91 83750 39642: Thoda manage krna pdega baki itna hectic nhi rhega.. 
And rest the things depends on how you manage.

29/09/2023, 21:57 - +91 88829 29741: @seniors can we ask question regarding coding  here ??? <This message was edited>
29/09/2023, 21:57 - +91 88608 81112: Yes feel free to ask
29/09/2023, 22:02 - +91 88829 29741: how to check whether user input is digit or string ?? 

This is one thing that I found most difficult switching from python to C++ that since variables are implicitly declared during declaration, if I enter value other than the variable data type it stops the program. 

How do I stop that ??
29/09/2023, 22:03 - +91 88829 29741: What I used to do in python was I used to check the user input in a while loop so that unless the input is of desired data type, the program kept on asking
29/09/2023, 22:05 - +91 83682 81898: Nahi aae hai!
29/09/2023, 22:05 - +91 98184 03158: use try catch statement
29/09/2023, 22:05 - +91 88829 29741: so like no other way around ??
29/09/2023, 22:10 - +91 98184 03158: basically the program stops running because of a runtime error... using try catch block allows you to set a proper response to that error instead of the whole program crashing
29/09/2023, 22:12 - +91 98737 60612: another method would be to take a string input and then further use regex to validate before type casting to your desired data type
29/09/2023, 22:17 - +91 87006 38646: Where do I learn object oriented programming in python from?
Tried a few yt videos but still couldn't get it
29/09/2023, 22:18 - +91 98737 60612: try searching for a game related project on YT because they tend to use OOP principles a lot

30/09/2023, 22:49 - +91 85276 22434: DSA se start karo
30/09/2023, 22:53 - +91 87005 29170: first year mei do what you like, dsa tum chaahe kam karlo, par explore development in the 1st year itself
30/09/2023, 23:03 - +91 88540 62590: By development u mean web dev/app dev or anything??
30/09/2023, 23:03 - +91 87005 29170: and ML
30/09/2023, 23:20 - +91 98716 72999: don't try ML, a LOT of math
30/09/2023, 23:22 - +91 87005 29170: do Try ML, it has a huge scope
30/09/2023, 23:23 - +91 87005 29170: dont believe in BS like this, continous work makes you better in any field you choose
30/09/2023, 23:24 - +91 83048 57842: Cmon ML is noice
30/09/2023, 23:24 - +91 87005 29170: finally, some wise words
30/09/2023, 23:24 - +91 98716 72999: Its fun to actually do things with it
30/09/2023, 23:24 - +91 83048 57842: Web dev is gay honestly
30/09/2023, 23:24 - +91 98716 72999: Like testing models and stuff on data
30/09/2023, 23:25 - +91 83048 57842: Exactly
30/09/2023, 23:25 - +91 98716 72999: but the math is weird, I just meant üòÇ
30/09/2023, 23:25 - +91 83048 57842: U will love math eventually dw
30/09/2023, 23:26 - +91 98716 72999: I don't hate math, I just want to take some time to understand the math behind those algorithms
30/09/2023, 23:26 - +91 98716 72999: üíÄ
30/09/2023, 23:26 - +91 98716 72999: its no fun without it
30/09/2023, 23:26 - +91 83048 57842: I see obviously it does but telling ML is crap cuz math is there in it doent digest for few u get it
30/09/2023, 23:27 - +91 98716 72999: I didn't say its crap Cmon bro üòÇ

30/09/2023, 23:27 - +91 98716 72999: its just better when you know the math
30/09/2023, 23:27 - +91 83048 57842: Yepp
30/09/2023, 23:28 - +91 88829 29741: its not that bad, is it ??

30/09/2023, 23:46 - +91 88829 29741: arey bhai ye toh aa gaya ki nodes se connect hai lekin pointer daaloon kaise code mein ??
30/09/2023, 23:46 - +91 88829 29741: vo toh usne sikhaya hi nhi
30/09/2023, 23:47 - +91 98182 16780: Ha theory hota hai fcc but wo bhi thik hai kahi se questions practice karlo basic and medium first year mei

01/10/2023, 10:02 - +91 80763 58455: C++ ke liye?
01/10/2023, 10:55 - +91 88829 29741: bhaiya jab hum kisi function mein array as argument daalte hai toh vo pass by reference jaata hai ya pass by value ??? <This message was edited>
01/10/2023, 11:01 - +91 87005 29170: Voh course koi itna helpful nahi hai XD , 2nd year mei bhi tum voh course YouTube se he karoge üôÇ

01/10/2023, 11:02 - +91 87005 29170: Bruh, function mei agr "&" use karoge params mei toh pass by reference
01/10/2023, 11:03 - +91 88829 29741: maine kahin padha tha ki arrays are by default pass by reference
01/10/2023, 11:03 - +91 88829 29741: isiliye poocha üôÉ
01/10/2023, 11:05 - +91 87005 29170: Haa sahi padha hai, array is nothing but pointer locations right isliye hum pass by reference bolte by default
01/10/2023, 12:23 - +91 74284 07090: Any macbook users ??
01/10/2023, 12:26 - +91 93106 07234: M1 in 2023 worth it ?
01/10/2023, 12:27 - +91 70112 68303: if you are looking at the macbook Air, M1 is actually better than M2, since M2 thermal throttles a lot more than M1
01/10/2023, 12:32 - +91 70112 68303: adding onto that, the price difference between the two is egregious (in a typical apple fashion)
01/10/2023, 12:34 - +91 93195 32200: Is a gaming pc better then a laptop, given that I have a laptop without a gpu already?
01/10/2023, 12:36 - +91 98188 82237: Is m1 like good for students? I mean like it will stop receiving updates in next 2 years so..
01/10/2023, 12:36 - +91 82870 20949: Depends
If u have a Mac then it's debatable
Else it's better anyways
But you should take according to your work
01/10/2023, 12:36 - +91 98188 82237: And like can you download pirated softwares in m1?
01/10/2023, 12:37 - +91 93195 32200: I don't have a mac
01/10/2023, 12:37 - +91 93106 07234: M1 vs gaming window laptop (both aprrx 80k)???
Kya better rhega
01/10/2023, 12:38 - +91 82870 20949: Choose according to what work do you want to do, how good is your old one functioning,etc
01/10/2023, 12:38 - +91 98188 82237: What are the windows laptop that are better than macbook air m1?
01/10/2023, 12:38 - +91 98188 82237: And at that price only(70k)?
01/10/2023, 12:39 - +91 93195 32200: ok thank you
01/10/2023, 12:39 - +91 85276 22434: Performance and battery life wise mac is way better
01/10/2023, 12:39 - +91 70112 68303: the one reason I won't leave windows üòÇ
01/10/2023, 12:40 - +91 98188 82237: Thats why i am asking
01/10/2023, 12:40 - +91 98188 82237: Like from what i have heard you have to buy everything in mac
01/10/2023, 12:40 - +91 85276 22434: Baaki gaming laptop ka fayda hai as in the name *gaming*
01/10/2023, 12:41 - +91 85276 22434: Na, mil jaate hai softwares
01/10/2023, 12:41 - +91 98188 82237: How?
01/10/2023, 12:41 - +91 70112 68303: pirating scene hoga hi, I am pretty sure
but since demands are higher for windows, hacking groups often give priority to them
unless the software you are pirating happens to be mac specific
01/10/2023, 12:41 - +91 87001 33052: 90k me koi gaming laptop bta do
01/10/2023, 12:41 - +91 70112 68303: reddit par dhundho
kuch na kuch toh mil hi jayega
01/10/2023, 12:42 - +91 82870 20949: Look, idts 70k me windows wala Macbook air ke competition ka milega

Aur agar milega toh uski build quality kharab hogi
01/10/2023, 12:43 - +91 70112 68303: the only caveat I see is 256GB storage on the macbook air
I personally think its too low
01/10/2023, 12:43 - +91 98188 82237: And plus i think iphone ke sath mac ki compatibility bhi acchi hojati hai if i am correct?
01/10/2023, 12:44 - +91 98188 82237: Ya but we can use a hard disk
01/10/2023, 12:44 - +91 82870 20949: Yes 
It becomes an ecosystem
01/10/2023, 12:44 - +91 70112 68303: and the 512gb model costs wayyy higher
01/10/2023, 12:44 - +91 70112 68303: ab woh baat toh hai
but portability gets a hit
01/10/2023, 12:45 - +91 82870 20949: A buyer can live with that
Moreover you have many options for cloud drive
01/10/2023, 12:45 - +91 70112 68303: still if you using a macbook air, I am pretty sure you aren't going to download loads of things anyways
01/10/2023, 12:45 - +91 78994 67337: Do u want portability or functionality
01/10/2023, 12:46 - +91 78994 67337: XPS 13 is the only thing but it's like triple the price
01/10/2023, 12:46 - +91 78994 67337: Basically the whole XPS series
01/10/2023, 12:47 - +91 83048 57842: Shiv cmon m so happy i hv 1 üòÖ
01/10/2023, 12:47 - +91 83048 57842: made me go bankrupt as well
01/10/2023, 12:47 - +91 78994 67337: MacBooks are the best thing in their price range if ur not gonna do heavy work like editing rendering or playing video games
01/10/2023, 12:47 - +91 78994 67337: Its so good
01/10/2023, 12:48 - +91 78994 67337: And idt anything beats MacBooks in terms of build quality
01/10/2023, 12:48 - +91 83048 57842: True for the performance to price ratio plus portability hands down to mac
01/10/2023, 12:49 - +91 82870 20949: Well companies like Lenovo, HPand Dell can compete <This message was edited>

01/10/2023, 12:54 - +91 83048 57842: Ryt
01/10/2023, 12:54 - +91 82870 20949: Bro touchscreen ke chakkar me 1lakh zyada charge karte h

08/10/2023, 07:56 - +91 80763 58455: Flutter or Unity?
Kaunsa better hai?
08/10/2023, 08:09 - +91 98737 60612: Controller support,3D etc. Mei unity would be better because this stuff comes in built.
But for light casual games ( turn based / card based etc. ) ke liye flutter might be better since by itself flutter is not a game engine which makes it less demanding in general.
08/10/2023, 08:09 - +91 98737 60612: Pros nd Cons hai dono kei
Requirements kei hisab sei choose ig
08/10/2023, 08:10 - +91 98737 60612: Unity ki latest monetization policy changes might also be an issue

08/10/2023, 21:25 - +91 95409 04312: @Seniors 

Suppose we want to go to the lab (apart from the regular classes) and perform the experiments to get the readings, are we allowed?
08/10/2023, 21:25 - +91 99716 64794: like going to perform your experiments with some other section?
08/10/2023, 21:26 - +91 95409 04312: Not exactly. 

I mean, like suppose when we are free, can we just go there and perform?
08/10/2023, 21:27 - +91 99716 64794: it depends
08/10/2023, 21:27 - +91 95409 04312: Depends on what?
08/10/2023, 21:28 - +91 85276 22434: In short nhi labs mai kabhi bhi allowed nhi hota, only in your practical period.

But you can ask the lab assistant or your professor to make an exception
08/10/2023, 21:29 - +91 85276 22434: Kyunki professor ka hona bhi zaroori hota hai lab mai and wo free nhi hote har time
08/10/2023, 21:30 - +91 95409 04312: Okay, thanks a lot! 


Then I will need to make up the readings myself üòí

14/10/2023, 13:08 - +91 87506 08600: Hello DevComm members,
In our recent session, only 5-6 members were present, making offline organization quite challenging. We understand that attending online sessions might not be as easy for you to understand than us organising it that is why we try and arrange offline sessions for you. Learning GIT and GitHub is crucial in the development field, and these sessions are valuable for you choosing your field of work in next 2-3 years. To ensure that no one is sent back bcz students didn't show up . I'm very disheartened by your response, hence, we'll have all sessions *online* from now on. 
Best regards.
14/10/2023, 13:13 - +91 95409 04312: But WebDev offline event mein 100+ members the. 

I don't know ki GitHub wale session mein bacche kyu nahi aaye. (Maybe because of late timings)
14/10/2023, 13:13 - +91 95409 04312: All sessions online isn't funü•≤
14/10/2023, 13:14 - +91 87506 08600: If you're not attending, it's not fun for us either
14/10/2023, 13:15 - +91 95409 04312: I attended the GitHub session
14/10/2023, 13:15 - +91 95409 04312: Even I was shocked to see such low response

14/10/2023, 13:16 - +91 70114 18573: Well I mentioned in web dev  that I want you all to make most of the 1000 rupees that you pay . But your response in the GitHub session was very poor , we had to send the speaker back as there were only 5 - 6 attendees. We would conduct further events offline only if we see a good number of requests for the offline session.
14/10/2023, 13:17 - +91 95409 04312: Okay, I can understand. 

But do keep some offline sessions in between as well(maybe 10% of them can be offline)

15/10/2023, 21:52 - +91 88275 64943: Dear DevWeek Participants,

We hope this message finds you well and excited for tomorrow's App Development session at DevWeek! To ensure a smooth and productive experience, it is crucial that you have Android Studio installed on your laptops before the session begins.

Android Studio is an essential tool for Android app development, and having it pre-installed will allow you to actively participate in hands-on exercises and follow along seamlessly with the session.

Visit the Official Android Studio Website:
Go to https://developer.android.com/studio

*For your convenience here is the Link for How to install Android Studio and Configure with Flutter:*
https://youtu.be/9WT9s7jkGEQ?si=_SjPVZ5qZ451Fa6h

By having Android Studio ready beforehand, you'll be able to dive into the practical aspects of app development right from the start. If you encounter any issues during the installation process, feel free to reach out to Me or consult the official documentation.

We look forward to an engaging and informative session. Thank you for your cooperation, and see you at DevWeek!

Best regards,

Adib Ahmed Siddiqui

06/11/2023, 11:03 - +91 80768 23330: Good morning everyone! Today‚Äôs DSA session is on the topic of TREES.  

Most of you might think that a topic like TREES would require a lot of knowledge about coding and if someone doesn‚Äôt know much about coding, he/she shall not be able to understand TREES. So just to clarify this doubt there is nothing like that, anybody can understand the concept of TREES despite the fact that how much coding he/she knows.

So I‚Äôll recommend you all to attend the session and make the best of your membership in devcomm.

08/12/2023, 19:37 - +91 88308 75114: Yaar pehle se decide krke mat rakho especially 1st yr mai toh
08/12/2023, 19:37 - +91 88308 75114: Ek preference hai theek hai
08/12/2023, 19:37 - +91 88308 75114: Open raho sab try karo
08/12/2023, 19:38 - +91 88264 90096: Try to sab kr rkha hai but kuch ek mainstream chahiye
08/12/2023, 19:38 - +91 72069 47421: According to me start with learning basics of python but abhi se decide mat karo ki sirf data science hi karni h explore karo but for now start python
08/12/2023, 19:39 - +91 88264 90096: Ok ....so CPP and Java agar baad mein Krna padta hai to wo to 2nd 3rd mein kra Jaa skta hai na?
08/12/2023, 19:39 - +91 72069 47421: Ha ez
08/12/2023, 19:40 - +91 72069 47421: And agar legit abhi se start karoge python acha h mene thodi late kari thi
08/12/2023, 19:40 - +91 72069 47421: Main bhi sirf data science and ML karta
08/12/2023, 19:41 - +91 88264 90096: To done then....thank you so much üôèüôè
08/12/2023, 19:41 - +91 72069 47421: Maine bhi bhaut cheeje dekhi webdev dsa wagerah end m yehi acha laga to yehi karta ab only
08/12/2023, 19:41 - +91 72069 47421: But ek baar explore jaruur karna sab
08/12/2023, 19:42 - +91 88264 90096: Yes..will do...tysm!!
08/12/2023, 19:45 - +91 98687 10209: @seniors agar c++ start karni hai toh what courses from where would you suggest buying?
08/12/2023, 20:07 - +91 98189 07290: Buy se better youtube pe free courses h kafi love babbar etc wo lelo
08/12/2023, 20:07 - +91 98189 07290: Agar buy krna hi h to codingninjas
08/12/2023, 20:15 - +91 78383 83878: Ye bhi btado pls ki cpp ka course lene se pehle c online seekhe ya seedha cpp ka course buy krle
08/12/2023, 20:15 - +91 78383 83878: Aur cpp ka basics with dsa wala course lena h na?
08/12/2023, 20:16 - +91 83684 17196: You can directly start with cpp without studying C language. There is no dependency between these 2 languages. <This message was edited>
08/12/2023, 20:16 - +91 98189 07290: C and cpp are not related to frk ni pdta

13/12/2023, 01:17 - +91 89103 65330: Yes vs code sometimes does not work with antivirus (idk why). It should work fine after you deactivate antivirus.
13/12/2023, 01:18 - +91 82757 89907: Is this only way

13/12/2023, 22:52 - +91 99716 64794: Data structures and Algorithms

Discrete structures
13/12/2023, 22:52 - +91 87006 38646: Yeh sab kaunsi language mein honge
13/12/2023, 22:52 - +91 97112 28661: Ye second year mai hai ye second sem mai

But exam mei you won't be asked to write the code.
Also tum logo ka thoda course curriculum change hua hai so please confirm karlena professor se.
13/12/2023, 22:54 - +91 99716 64794: And discrete structures is not a practical subject
13/12/2023, 22:54 - +91 87006 38646: Actually DSA ka course Lena hai
Usme 2 options hai
Java and C++
Toh soch rha tha second sem mein jo language hogi ussi language ka course lelunga
13/12/2023, 22:54 - +91 87006 38646: What do you recommend?
13/12/2023, 22:54 - +91 99716 64794: C++ then, cause practical mei C/C++ is acceptable.
13/12/2023, 22:55 - +91 99716 64794: Though you guys didn't have C in the first semester right?
13/12/2023, 22:55 - +91 90236 48217: Nope we had python

15/12/2023, 00:01 - +91 88829 29741: ek aur question ye tha ki agar code h like

v.begin();

toh ismein v.begin() exactly deta kya h

IN CSS

body{
height: 1000px;
}

now since there is a scroll bar on the right side, the actual width of body decreases to about 1519.2 px instead of 100vw which is 1536px. In many divs I have assigned width = 100vw which is greater than the width of the body. This leads to a horizontal scroll bar on the bottom. How do I deal with the change in body width due to the vertical scroll bar. vw doesn't change but body width changes
15/12/2023, 23:14 - +91 85956 41634: bhai scroll bar width decrease nahi karta webpage

The problem is that the timing function only applies to first half that is 0% to 50% and then restarts from 50% to 100%. So in 1 keyframe, the timing function is being used twice. How do I make it so that it is used only once ?

22/12/2023, 21:44 - +91 88829 29741: why do we use tailwind css, I mean if I write all the style as inline styles, then the html gets really big and messy to look at. Isn't CSS better in that terms because we have separate file for styles ?
22/12/2023, 21:46 - +91 78278 38523: Tailwind also creates seprate CSS file
22/12/2023, 21:49 - +91 98716 02253: inline styles kahan badhte hain? these frameworks provide you with class names that you use
22/12/2023, 21:51 - +91 98716 02253: inline styles nahi badhte
22/12/2023, 21:51 - +91 98716 02253: each of those class names are given appropriate styles by the framework in a seperate css file that you link through cdn (or download locally)

31/12/2023, 21:18 - +91 88829 29741: but agar flex use karna h toh div pe use hoga button pe nhi
31/12/2023, 21:19 - +91 88829 29741: flex parent container pe use hota h
31/12/2023, 21:19 - +91 98716 72999: but button ko div ke andar hi rkhna h
31/12/2023, 21:19 - +91 88829 29741: so like agar button ko centre karna h toh parent div pe lagao display: flex, justify content center
31/12/2023, 21:20 - +91 97115 88132: I think  usse  kahi  iska pura  structre na bigad jaye ..

31/12/2023, 21:20 - +91 88829 29741: but ye properties button ko centre karengi wrt to parent div and agar parent div body ke centre mein nhi h toh difference pta nhi chalega
31/12/2023, 21:20 - +91 97115 88132: pura  uthal puthal mach jayega
31/12/2023, 21:20 - +91 88829 29741: depend karta h ki parent div ke andar kitni cheeze h, agar 1 button h sirf toh nhi hoga kuch bhi

From sophisticated layouts to dynamic animations, each line narrates a pixelated tale. Embracing challenges, pushing boundaries, and orchestrating digital symphonies.

Feeling lost like figuring out your life plan? Channel your inner "Aayein?" and let your memes do the panicking for you. Got someone acting like they're royalty? Hit 'em with the "Aukat Dekha Di" so fast, they'll be bowing down to your meme throne.

Life got you "Moye Moye"ing? Embrace the absurdity and meme your way through it. Or just yell "Ohio" and join the internet's latest head-scratcher. 

Date : 19th Jan
Time : 10A.M. onwards 
Venue : Main Auditorium

14/01/2024, 22:39 - +91 70658 18784: still no update, pl look into it .
14/01/2024, 22:45 - +91 99969 08470: We are aware of it kabeer

14/01/2024, 23:04 - +91 88829 29741: Hey everyone, I have a question regarding full stack web dev.

I learned react to intermediate level and want to move to full stack, so should I go for Next Js or Express Js.

I have build 1 full stack project with next js and I think it's better to do full stack this way because it makes connecting frontend to backend and API routing easy.

I have studied a little bit of express but not made any project so far. I think it might be difficult connecting backend frontend and API routing in express

But I could very well be wrong and next could be just something that looks easy but isn't actually used in real world or maybe express is just used more because it keeps backend and frontend seperated

So please help me with this whether I should go for Next or Express. I mean I have to learn data modelling and other stuff either way.
14/01/2024, 23:11 - +91 87449 20043: bhai, tu first year me hi ha na?
14/01/2024, 23:13 - +91 82870 20949: Inferiority complex = True
Confidence-=10
14/01/2024, 23:13 - +91 97115 88132: guys lets  not make this  a joke..

maybe he's really confused
14/01/2024, 23:14 - +91 88004 74731: Nope, NextJS imo is the way to go. In real life NextJS a lot of companies are migrating current react infra to nextjs, express is usefull but... utna time nhi lagta honestly to do express. So do next achhe se and uske saath agar side by side express kar sakte ho thoda well and good
14/01/2024, 23:15 - +91 88103 35592: @918744920043 meet Manasvi :)
14/01/2024, 23:15 - +91 88004 74731: Warna ive seen people just use flask/fast-api servers for backend, which is totally fine as well
14/01/2024, 23:15 - +91 95404 79733: I think Pehle express needed hai to actually understand how a server works
14/01/2024, 23:15 - +91 82870 20949: No, but he is way ahead of me rn (I rn am doing C) that's really giving me inferiority complex and lowering my confidence a bit
14/01/2024, 23:15 - +91 95404 79733: Varna fir server and client components samajhne me issue aayega nextjs me <This message was edited>
14/01/2024, 23:16 - +91 88004 74731: I did was i did poora front end with my backends initially in flask, easiest to work with and gives you basic understanding
14/01/2024, 23:16 - +91 88004 74731: Then you can move to express i guess
14/01/2024, 23:17 - +91 95404 79733: Ye bhi sahi hai par jab baat flask vs express pr aaye then I think express is the way to go
14/01/2024, 23:17 - +91 95404 79733: Also nextjs takes it to next level so basic understanding of the underlying parts is needed to actually work there. That's why I suggested express first
14/01/2024, 23:17 - +91 97115 88132: its okk  to feel  low.. but late kabhi nhi hota  start karna
14/01/2024, 23:18 - +91 88004 74731: Thaats fair
14/01/2024, 23:18 - +91 88004 74731: But again, express doesnt take utna time na
14/01/2024, 23:18 - +91 87449 20043: 0.

15/01/2024, 20:58 - +91 99969 08470: Please avoid doing that. You will get rejected in that case.
15/01/2024, 20:59 - +91 88829 29741: Hello seniors, I heard that there are devcomm mentor mentee groups. Is that true because I haven't been added in any
15/01/2024, 21:00 - +91 99969 08470: Try making a resume though. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you are in first year. Surely you can add your education and beginner skills there.
15/01/2024, 21:00 - +91 88006 45025: ok so can I resubmit my application
15/01/2024, 21:01 - +91 88006 45025: if not can I make an application from another email (like the NSUT mail)

17/01/2024, 11:54 - +91 83684 17196: capacity is the maximum number of characters that the string can currently hold without growing its size. size is how many characters actually exist in the string. max_size gives the maximum possible length that a string can have.
17/01/2024, 11:57 - +91 85276 22434: Basically, jab tum string k liye memory allocate karte ho to system req se jyada allocate kar deta hai, usko capacity. Jo actual need hai wo size

17/01/2024, 22:29 - +91 70112 68303: Ig its because it is showing days in terms of year 2023, not 2024
for example : 17th jan 2023 was a Tuesday
that's why dates are correct, days are wrong

17/01/2024, 22:37 - +91 70112 68303: even though the everything else on NSUTx (including the main page) is showing the correct date and days ü•≤
17/01/2024, 22:42 - +91 88275 64943: You are right
18/01/2024, 07:24 - +91 88829 29741: Jaise string class hoti h C++ mein, but actual method of storage kya hota h ? I mean fundamentally is it just a char array (C styled string) with inbuilt functions or is there some other way of storing data. Because string is not a fundamental data type (maybe I'm wrong) and it is mutable (str.erase()) whereas in python it's immutable
18/01/2024, 08:47 - +91 82870 20949: Idts str.erase() means you are making changes in the string
You are changing the value of the variable
Like in python:
S="string"
Can be changed to
S=""
18/01/2024, 08:48 - +91 88829 29741: Sense toh bana rha h
18/01/2024, 08:48 - +91 88829 29741: But fundamentally char array h ya kuch aur ?
18/01/2024, 08:48 - +91 82870 20949: CS50 me toh yhi kha tha
18/01/2024, 08:49 - +91 88829 29741: Char array?
18/01/2024, 08:49 - +91 82870 20949: Yep
18/01/2024, 08:49 - +91 88829 29741: Char array is c-styled string ?
18/01/2024, 08:49 - +91 82870 20949: Last char being '/0'
18/01/2024, 08:50 - +91 98716 72999: yis
18/01/2024, 08:50 - +91 82870 20949: I don't know what's c-styled
18/01/2024, 08:50 - +91 98716 72999: all strings are array of chars in disguise the way I see it lol
18/01/2024, 08:50 - +91 82870 20949: I am a beginner
18/01/2024, 08:51 - +91 82870 20949: It is taught that way only ig
(Prolly it is that only)
18/01/2024, 08:52 - +91 98716 72999: I think it is because when you create a string in the heap memory, you always get a pointer to it, pointing to the 0th index of the array of chars (I THINK)

25/01/2024, 16:46 - +91 88004 74731: Hi, quick question
For NSUTx why don't we have a caching api behind the api that caches the responses for user every time he logs in, in this case when ims is down the cached data can be returned and people will still be able to refer to and open past circulars and attendance stats and admit card and yada yada, you get the point
25/01/2024, 17:03 - +91 99969 08470: It was deliberately not included because showing stale data will result in chaos. Imagine you see your attendance 75% one day before attendance lock but it was an older data because your network request failed, but in reality your professor updated the attendance and you are sitting on 67%. The one to blame will be the app thn.
25/01/2024, 17:14 - +91 88004 74731: I mean... A disclaimer saying how old the cached data is and it should be taken with a grain of salt would do the trick I guess. Because this would solve the issue of circulars and admit cards not being accessible at last moments (not that it's recommended to leave things for the last moment, but in case)
25/01/2024, 17:15 - +91 88004 74731: "NOTE: Due to IMS being down the data shown below is of last cached date <insert data and time of the cache here>" <This message was edited>
25/01/2024, 17:15 - +91 88004 74731: Vaguely something like that
25/01/2024, 17:16 - +91 88004 74731: _orrrrr_ just cache certain stuff like the circulars section and all and lock down attendance section and other more sensitive sections when ims is down
25/01/2024, 17:17 - +91 88004 74731: Both ways could work(?)
25/01/2024, 17:36 - +91 99969 08470: Yeah, this would make sense. How about you learn app development and apply in next recruitment, thn you can try it out yourself. üåù
25/01/2024, 17:38 - +91 97112 28661: when does recruitment happen?
25/01/2024, 17:42 - +91 99969 08470: Recruitment is done for junior council as a whole with tasks for each department. Dates are not decided yet.
25/01/2024, 17:42 - +91 99969 08470: But if enough people are interested we can do a recruitment for app dev specifically. Let me know.
25/01/2024, 17:42 - +91 88004 74731: Will do :)

Output : ["a","3","b","4","c","4"] <This message was edited>
25/01/2024, 21:57 - +91 83684 17196: The question is to encode a string in terms of frequency of characters, right ?
25/01/2024, 21:57 - +91 88829 29741: Yes
25/01/2024, 21:57 - +91 88829 29741: String compression
25/01/2024, 21:57 - +91 88004 74731: Sahi toh hai, its encoding the number of times the chars repeat
25/01/2024, 21:57 - +91 88004 74731: a 3 times b 4 times c 4 times
25/01/2024, 21:57 - +91 88829 29741: Ha but Mera question tha ki extra values kahan gyi ?
25/01/2024, 21:57 - +91 88829 29741: Length choti ho rhi h but kaise ?
25/01/2024, 21:58 - +91 88004 74731: okay so what it does is, it starts counting from the start, lets say from a, uske baad it counts consecutively 4 times a comes, so it replaces all other 'a'  with just the number of times it repeats
25/01/2024, 21:58 - +91 88004 74731: So a,a,a,a becomes a,4 means a repeats 4 times
25/01/2024, 21:59 - +91 88829 29741: Ha konsi line ?
25/01/2024, 21:59 - +91 88829 29741: Vahi Mera question h

25/01/2024, 21:59 - +91 88004 74731: it keeps incrementing till the chars keep matching
25/01/2024, 22:00 - +91 88004 74731: uske baad breaks out
25/01/2024, 22:00 - +91 83684 17196: The length is not getting reduced, it finally returns the last index of character in ans, like sirf starting ki 6 values kaam ki hain, ignore the remaining characters <This message was edited>
25/01/2024, 22:00 - +91 88829 29741: Ha, but vo replacing vaala kaam. Which line does that ?
25/01/2024, 22:01 - +91 88004 74731: <Media omitted>
25/01/2024, 22:01 - +91 88829 29741: Toh iska size abhi bhi 11 h ?

25/01/2024, 22:01 - +91 88004 74731: <Media omitted>
25/01/2024, 22:02 - +91 88829 29741: Toh does it become something like [a,3,b,4,c,4,b,c,c,c,c] ?
25/01/2024, 22:02 - +91 88829 29741: But only returns till 6 because ansIndex = 6
25/01/2024, 22:03 - +91 83684 17196: Yes
25/01/2024, 22:03 - +91 83684 17196: Wo driver code handle krta hai, u don't need to worry about that

25/01/2024, 22:05 - +91 97112 28661: Dono ways se kar sakta hu
25/01/2024, 22:05 - +91 88829 29741: Bhej do, ek baar idea lag jayega of another approach
25/01/2024, 22:05 - Kavish Devcom: Geeks for geeks per article pdlo maps ka use hota hai kafi
25/01/2024, 22:06 - +91 88829 29741: Acha, I'll do that
25/01/2024, 22:06 - Kavish Devcom: Easy to handle problems involving frequency and so
25/01/2024, 22:07 - +91 88004 74731: just adding `chars.resize(ansIndex);` will do that na since we assume all elements after our overwritten elements as stale..?
25/01/2024, 22:08 - +91 88829 29741: Pta nhi, code ko kaise pta chalega ki values that are not overwritten are stale ?
25/01/2024, 22:09 - +91 88004 74731: that we decide since jitna overwrite kiya is all that we want which is till ansIndex, uske baad ka use useless so we yeet it
25/01/2024, 22:09 - +91 88829 29741: That's exactly what I just thought
25/01/2024, 22:09 - +91 88829 29741: Ki loop ke bahar end mein we'll do like a chars.erase(ansIndex)
25/01/2024, 22:10 - +91 88829 29741: Or whatever the function may be
25/01/2024, 22:10 - +91 88004 74731: yeah
25/01/2024, 22:11 - +91 88829 29741: Anyways thanks a lot, I was stuck at it for about 40 minutes thinking how did he resize the vector
25/01/2024, 22:12 - +91 97112 28661: Abhi bheju code ya you understood
25/01/2024, 22:13 - +91 88829 29741: Ha aa gya samajh, agar resize karna ho toh while ke end mein kardenge

28/01/2024, 13:18 - +91 98189 07290: p is an address pointer of z
28/01/2024, 13:19 - +91 98189 07290: Those random letters are the address of the variable ch which is z so that is printed if only p is called
28/01/2024, 13:19 - +91 98189 07290: But other 2 lines access the variable present at the address p i.e.- ch and not the address so z will be printed
28/01/2024, 13:21 - +91 88829 29741: but the problem is that when those two lines are commented, this thing works normally
28/01/2024, 13:21 - +91 88829 29741: but when I uncomment it, then it behaves differently
28/01/2024, 13:21 - +91 88829 29741: <Media omitted>
28/01/2024, 13:21 - +91 98189 07290: send ss of both the cases
28/01/2024, 13:22 - +91 88829 29741: shouldn't this still print "z" then some random character for first output ?
28/01/2024, 13:22 - +91 88829 29741: the same way it did here
28/01/2024, 13:22 - +91 88829 29741: and also why is its address so weird ?
28/01/2024, 13:22 - +91 88829 29741: its not the normal hexadecimal address
28/01/2024, 13:23 - +91 98189 07290: ha address ni h wo abhi dekha
28/01/2024, 13:23 - +91 98189 07290: lemme see
28/01/2024, 13:27 - +91 98189 07290: ha see isme &p se address access krte h my bad phle glt bola tha to isme shi h address hi dikha rha
*p se z hi print hoga
28/01/2024, 13:28 - +91 98189 07290: jo sirf p wali line h usme wo compiler ki dikkt hoti h wo use kya interpret kre
28/01/2024, 13:28 - +91 98189 07290: isilie mostly cout function use ni krte directly pointer function pe & ya * se hi krlo
28/01/2024, 13:28 - +91 88829 29741: agar p was pointing to a character array, then it would print the entire array right ? because std::cout works differently for characters
28/01/2024, 13:28 - +91 88829 29741: ??
28/01/2024, 13:29 - +91 85276 22434: Isko dubara run karke output dekho, tab bhi sirf z aarha first mai?
28/01/2024, 13:29 - +91 85276 22434: Second third to I think clear hai
28/01/2024, 13:30 - +91 98189 07290: ha puri string hi print hogi usme
28/01/2024, 13:30 - +91 88829 29741: <Media omitted>
28/01/2024, 13:31 - +91 85276 22434: First mai, c++ char pointer ko bhi ek null terminated string k Tarah treat karta, to z ka address hai p mai so next null tak print kardega
28/01/2024, 13:31 - +91 85276 22434: Isme by chance tumhara null character z k baad hi aagaya
28/01/2024, 13:32 - +91 88829 29741: hn hn vhi explanation diya h
28/01/2024, 13:32 - +91 85276 22434: Haan sahi hai fir
28/01/2024, 13:32 - +91 88829 29741: ki agar char ch = 'z' h aur ek pointer isko point kar rha h aur us pointer ko print kiya toh kyunki char h toh cout tab tak print karega jab tak null character nhi milta
28/01/2024, 13:33 - +91 88829 29741: par mera doubt tha ki jaise aapne yahan bola ki tukka h
28/01/2024, 13:33 - +91 88829 29741: lekin jab last 2 line comment thi tab ye tukka kabhi nhi laga
28/01/2024, 13:33 - +91 88829 29741: vo h mera doubt
28/01/2024, 13:34 - +91 98189 07290: whi baat h compiler ki baat h kaise usko dekhle null terminated string ki trh ya nhi isme humesha dilemma hi rhega
isilie kbhi directly ni dete pointer ko
28/01/2024, 13:34 - +91 98189 07290: *p ya &p hi use kro
28/01/2024, 13:34 - +91 88829 29741: aur ek aur doubt tha ki for example, lets say this pointer points to address 700, so it prints 'z' at 700, then does it move on to next adjacent memory address ?
28/01/2024, 13:34 - +91 98189 07290: compiler kya kr rha ab isme kuch kr ni skte hum
28/01/2024, 13:35 - +91 88829 29741: achaa
28/01/2024, 13:35 - +91 85276 22434: Haan continuous memory k tarah
28/01/2024, 13:35 - +91 88829 29741: toh adjacent memory block mein null character hoga ye kaise ?
28/01/2024, 13:35 - +91 85276 22434: If next memory is a integer tab bhi usse wo as a Char read kar lega
28/01/2024, 13:35 - +91 88829 29741: matlab side vali memory block khali bhi toh ho skti h na ?
28/01/2024, 13:37 - +91 88829 29741: aur ye toh risky h na ? if it just keep traversing like this doesn't that make it similar to a pointer with garbage value ?
28/01/2024, 13:37 - +91 98189 07290: Garbage value hogi
28/01/2024, 13:37 - +91 85276 22434: Yes ye risky hai, isiliye pointers k saath carefully manage karna hota hai
28/01/2024, 13:37 - +91 88829 29741: toh memory khali nhi hoti kya ?
28/01/2024, 13:38 - +91 88829 29741: matlab if I have unused memory toh will it have garbage value everywhere ?
28/01/2024, 13:38 - +91 98189 07290: Pointers mainly to array aur strings mei hi deal krte ho in real life
28/01/2024, 13:38 - +91 98189 07290: Ha jaise tu koi random address block ki value ko print krega agar to garbage value ani chahiye
28/01/2024, 13:39 - +91 88829 29741: one last question, lets say I have a brand new ssd, so is it basically full of garbage value instead of like empty of containing null ?
28/01/2024, 13:40 - +91 98189 07290: acha undefined variables ke lie keh rha kya
28/01/2024, 13:40 - +91 85276 22434: Basically agar assume kar rhe hai ki next block is empty (saare bits 0 hai) to iska behaviour random ho sakta hai, based on processor and c++ compiler
28/01/2024, 13:40 - +91 88829 29741: hn matlab maanlo koi memory bilkul brand new h vaise
28/01/2024, 13:41 - +91 98189 07290: usko agar bina kuch assign kre access krega to risk hota system crash etc bhi ho skta <This message was edited>
28/01/2024, 13:41 - +91 85276 22434: Unpredictable hota hai ye, exact answer nhi bata sakte
28/01/2024, 13:41 - +91 88829 29741: similar to garbage value pointer ?
28/01/2024, 13:42 - +91 88829 29741: toh matlab we don't know what it holds ?
28/01/2024, 13:42 - +91 85276 22434: Yup
28/01/2024, 13:42 - +91 98189 07290: dekh agar tne koi dynamic memory allocate ki new etc use krke to usme grabage value rhegi
28/01/2024, 13:42 - +91 98189 07290: agar aisa kuch ni kia phle seedha access krega to random behaviour jaisa bhaiya ne kha
28/01/2024, 13:43 - +91 88829 29741: matlab basically manufacturer ko hi nhi pta ki usne jo banaya h usmein kya h üòÇ
28/01/2024, 13:46 - +91 85276 22434: Baaki isme tumhara comment/uncomment ka solution ye hai, your compiler is allocating the same memory for z in the code with commented lines and the same (different from first) address for without commented code for multiple execution. As agar baar baar run karo to same hi output aarha na *p* ka
28/01/2024, 13:47 - +91 85276 22434: Think of it as caching, code har baar nayi address nhi allot kar rha, isiliye Aisa lag rha ki without comments and with comments ka ans different aarha
28/01/2024, 13:50 - +91 85276 22434: No,ab jo bana rha wo manually bits thodi set karta hai, generally garbage values are there kyunki ab tak initialise hi nhi hui hai wo block
28/01/2024, 19:00 - +91 92894 03760: Kisi ke pass EM ke notes h?

03/02/2024, 22:50 - Kavish Devcom: Firstly, array ko directly print nahi kra sakte cout se
Secondly, range ke bahar access nahi hora, vo garbage value dera hai <This message was edited>
03/02/2024, 22:52 - +91 88829 29741: hn but when I passed it in function it gives garbage value, but otherwise it gives error. That's what I meant to ask
03/02/2024, 22:54 - +91 98182 16780: Pehle tu direct access kar raha hai tu iss wajah se error aa raha hai c++ me loop laga ke kar raha hai isliye wo garbage value de raha hai
03/02/2024, 22:55 - +91 88829 29741: toh loop ke time pe vo pointer mein decay ho rha h ?
03/02/2024, 22:55 - +91 98182 16780: Wo condition ke mutabik ja raha hai wo array ke beyond chale ja raha hai
03/02/2024, 23:01 - Kavish Devcom: Not necessarily agar loop na bhi lagao tab bhi arr[20] per vo garbage value de sakta hai 
Depends on the compiler
03/02/2024, 23:03 - +91 88829 29741: agar main direct arr[20] karu toh error aayega, but loop ke andar nhi aata error
03/02/2024, 23:04 - Kavish Devcom: Me vohi kera hu 
Compiler per depend krta hai 
It may bhi possible ki vo Bina loop kr garbage value de
03/02/2024, 23:05 - Kavish Devcom: Ek online compiler per run krke dekh u will get my point
03/02/2024, 23:05 - +91 88829 29741: aisa toh nhi ki direct arr[20] ke time compiler ko pta h ki main array ki 20th index value access kar rha hu but array utna lamba h hi nhi toh usne error throw kar diya.

but loop ke andar arr[I] h, aur compiler har arr[I] check nhi karega compile karte time isliye error na diya ho aur execution ke time garbage value dedi ?
03/02/2024, 23:05 - +91 88829 29741: acha
03/02/2024, 23:06 - Kavish Devcom: Yes

08/02/2024, 14:49 - +91 76830 92225: Do anyone know if i have made a website and it can be opened in pc but how to make it versatile for opening in phone also
08/02/2024, 14:57 - +91 83684 17196: U need to follow some responsiveness guidelines while developing the website.
08/02/2024, 14:58 - +91 88829 29741: If it's a simple html website, then use live server, write your wifi IP address and chante laptop wifi setting.
08/02/2024, 14:58 - +91 88829 29741: Connect with same wifi on phone and search the ip
08/02/2024, 14:58 - +91 85956 41634: You mean responsive
08/02/2024, 14:58 - +91 85956 41634: ?
08/02/2024, 14:58 - +91 88829 29741: Basically read the live server vs code extension on how to change host ip
08/02/2024, 14:58 - +91 83684 17196: To make a website responsive, use CSS media queries to adjust layout based on screen size. Use flexible grids and units like percentages for layout.
10/02/2024, 20:15 - +91 88829 29741: If I can change value of private properties in classes using getters and setters then what even is the use of private class or protected class ? The only need I found was that private properties can't be inherited but protected can be but then again if I just use getters and setters then what's the point of it being different from public ?? can anyone help me with this ??
10/02/2024, 20:16 - +91 85956 41634: its a practice, as i insteady of hard code, we can use function as  pass the value to set or get
10/02/2024, 20:18 - +91 97115 88132: there are  two  things  you need to understand



    Private: limits access to members within the class itself,it ensures encapsulation by hiding implementation details and prevents direct external modification.

    Protected: allows access within the class and its subclasses, facilitating inheritance and specialization while still maintaining control over member visibility.
10/02/2024, 20:19 - +91 97115 88132: using getters and setters with private properties provides controlled access, but private and protected modifiers offer additional levels of encapsulation and inheritance control which  ensures data integrity and security in object-oriented design
10/02/2024, 20:21 - +91 88829 29741: so its just a way to prevent accidental changes to value by making change accessible through pre defined methods only ??
10/02/2024, 20:21 - +91 97115 88132: yes..!
10/02/2024, 20:22 - +91 85956 41634: simple answer- encapusalution, as we may want to set the value in different fashion that we don't we want user /client to know
10/02/2024, 20:22 - +91 88829 29741: and protected is there to get the benefits of protected while getting the benefits of inheritance ??
10/02/2024, 20:23 - +91 97115 88132: yes
10/02/2024, 20:23 - +91 97115 88132: exactly
10/02/2024, 20:24 - +91 88829 29741: a bit off topic but, the client is not gonna see the code but the product right ?? so its upto me on how I design the program and the client can't just use a= b anywhere
10/02/2024, 20:25 - +91 88829 29741: or is it like giving the source code to the client but since the client doesn't really know a lot, he can't accidentally change properties because there is a particularly different way of dealing with those ?
10/02/2024, 20:25 - +91 97115 88132: ye its upto you   .. how  u want your program to behave .. making  some boundaries for better optimisation and  secutrity
10/02/2024, 20:26 - +91 85956 41634: in that case,  let  assume you made setter function that set the value to nth term fib as that it much more easier than harder code the value,
10/02/2024, 20:26 - +91 97115 88132: it could..  and even  if  he did change the code .. he would need your knowledge or expertise to change  or optimise the program
10/02/2024, 20:28 - +91 97115 88132: these  things basically uses inheritance control and  encapsulation

for data integrity  and security

13/04/2024, 18:18 - +91 88006 45025: That is it

05/05/2024, 13:24 - +91 87006 38646: I have a DELL laptop
It overheats a lot even with just WhatsApp and chrome running on it
I can hear the fan running at all times
Looking up on the internet I was advised to clean the vents with compressed air
So do I take it to a DELL authorized centre or any laptop repair shop will work?
05/05/2024, 13:25 - +91 83048 57842: Its advised to go to dell authorized service centers
05/05/2024, 13:28 - +91 88004 74731: If you laptop is new, you might wanna save your warranty hence dell authorized service center would be a better choice, if it's already out of warranty then there really isn't much point especially for a trivial task such as cleaning up the vents
05/05/2024, 13:33 - +91 87006 38646: Just checked, it's out of warranty
05/05/2024, 13:33 - +91 88264 90096: How old is your laptop?
What's the model?
When did the problem start?
05/05/2024, 13:37 - +91 87006 38646: More than 2 years
Latitude 5411(has an NVIDIA graphics card also)
More than a year
05/05/2024, 13:38 - +91 88004 74731: Yeahh a repair shop would doo, watch them while they do it so next time it can be you and your handy screw driver against the world
05/05/2024, 13:39 - +91 88004 74731: _with a touch of isopropyl alcohol ofc_
05/05/2024, 13:40 - +91 88264 90096: Yes exactly
05/05/2024, 13:40 - +91 87006 38646: Okay thanks!

15/05/2024, 19:10 - +91 97115 88132: It totally depends upon the constraints
15/05/2024, 19:21 - +91 88267 09701: Iterations are preferred, kyuki usme stack space use nhi hota, recursion is just easy to code and visualize
15/05/2024, 21:30 - +91 80763 58455: Okay thanks

16/05/2024, 17:20 - +91 88829 29741: They support functions similar to states, props and hooks ??
16/05/2024, 17:21 - +91 88829 29741: And similar to jsx
16/05/2024, 17:21 - +91 88829 29741: ??
16/05/2024, 17:21 - +91 88829 29741: In the sense of how we write html and js in functional component. In that sense
16/05/2024, 17:22 - +91 87449 20043: I had previously used flask , no there are not alike
16/05/2024, 17:23 - +91 87449 20043: They are similar to ejs <This message was edited>
16/05/2024, 17:23 - +91 88829 29741: I've only used flask a bit and I feel it's similar to express but not next
16/05/2024, 20:55 - +91 88829 29741: if I am taking a file (pdf for example) using forms and inputs and saving it locally then one way is to read the data and then send to api then write locally.

is there some way that we can just send the file itself through api and save the file itself locally without copying data instead ?
17/05/2024, 00:28 - +91 82220 54380: How much css is enough for frontend development??
17/05/2024, 00:28 - +91 82220 54380: Are we supposed to do flexbox, grid, bootstrap??
17/05/2024, 00:30 - +91 97115 88132: to be honest you need a lot more than this  .. to be called a good frontend developer
17/05/2024, 00:30 - +91 97115 88132: everything
17/05/2024, 00:31 - +91 82220 54380: Can you recommend good resources?

17/05/2024, 00:32 - +91 97115 88132: yupp.
17/05/2024, 00:37 - +91 84476 93183: Any video of freecodecamp yt channel. Ogs in the dev space imo.
17/05/2024, 00:38 - +91 84476 93183: Bootstrap is technically not a part of css , its one the library devs use to ease the process of writing css. In my opinion in the starting we should focus on core css and leave lib like tailwind/bootstrap for later.
17/05/2024, 00:50 - +91 84476 93183: If someone here has tried bcrypt (password hashing library), is there any good alternative to it?
17/05/2024, 00:52 - +91 88004 74731: Alternative in js or any other lingo? Any particular reason for not using bcrypt itself?
17/05/2024, 00:54 - +91 84476 93183: I have used it in one of project. When I tried to host the backend to  some server (it starts with h or something), I was unable to do so.

17/05/2024, 00:56 - +91 88004 74731: how are you using bcrypt? saving passwords? if so im guessing youd be using mongo with it?
17/05/2024, 00:56 - +91 84476 93183: yes
17/05/2024, 00:57 - +91 84476 93183: yes ig
17/05/2024, 00:57 - +91 88004 74731: Might wanna cross check if its issues with mongo being installed in the first place
17/05/2024, 00:57 - +91 88004 74731: Bcrypt is generally a simple library so shouldn't cause much issues in the first place
17/05/2024, 00:58 - +91 88004 74731: Otherwise if its a dependency issue with bcrypt then you may use this
https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs
It is free of any foreign dependencies
17/05/2024, 00:59 - +91 84476 93183: I was able to host the backend but I had to lower down the version. Which caused problem like GitHub started giving me security issue warning ü´†

27/05/2024, 19:13 - +91 96229 70058: As my time at this college draws to a close, I will fondly remember the time I spent in DevComm. Organizing events, 24-hour hackathons, collaborating on projects and of course the amazing (and eventful, ifykyk) sleepovers in Smart Block. 

Thanks to DevComm, I ended up being friends with some of the most intelligent and supportive¬†seniors.

In the end, I guess it doesn't matter which 'society' you are a part of, what matters is the memories you made along the way, and more importantly, the people you made them with. So, to my friends within and beyond DevComm: thank you for making college bearable at 9 in the morning and making it unforgettable at 9¬†in¬†the¬†night¬†:)

06/06/2024, 21:36 - +91 99716 64794: guys the test cases are verified.
06/06/2024, 21:36 - +91 99716 64794: i can assure there's nothing wrong with them
06/06/2024, 21:36 - +91 99716 64794: edge cases hoti hai sometime
06/06/2024, 21:36 - +91 99716 64794: was it the last test case?
06/06/2024, 21:37 - +91 95409 04312: Yes, the test cases might be fine but partial score was not given even though 4/5 were passed
06/06/2024, 21:37 - +91 95409 04312: Bob's String Theory
06/06/2024, 21:37 - +91 99716 64794: guys last question had just two answers
think about it, if one just outputs 1 or 0
the person will still get partially marked,
06/06/2024, 21:38 - +91 80763 58455: sir
06/06/2024, 21:38 - +91 80763 58455: i can assure you
06/06/2024, 21:38 - +91 80763 58455: my code is right
06/06/2024, 21:38 - +91 88267 09701: It was an easy question, it really didn't need the partial marking at all
06/06/2024, 21:38 - +91 80763 58455: leetcode pe bhi bohot baar hota hai ki kabhi cases match nahi karte but then when i resubmit ho jaate hai match
06/06/2024, 21:38 - +91 80763 58455: but ispe to hue hi nahi
06/06/2024, 21:38 - +91 99716 64794: @918076358455 baaki question kiye hai?
06/06/2024, 21:39 - +91 95409 04312: Yes it was easy, but due to some edge case the code failed, 

Still should have got some partial for passing 4/5
06/06/2024, 21:39 - +91 80763 58455: 4th nahi kiya
06/06/2024, 21:39 - +91 80763 58455: that cycle wala, i couldn't do it
06/06/2024, 21:40 - +91 93191 30448: I think the seniors have clarified already that because the ques was so easy, they didn't have partial marking for that ques.
06/06/2024, 21:41 - +91 88267 09701: Ok don't worry guyz we will keep all your points in consideration while shortlisting u guyz 
As of know don't worry we will share ans key in a while

08/06/2024, 16:35 - +91 98189 07290: Backend is not deployed thats why its axios error
08/06/2024, 16:38 - +91 84476 93183: the thing is site was working fine without backend being uploaded. out of the blue mene code GitHub pr push kiya vercel ne site update kari aur tabse ye error hai. And bina backend deploy kare bhi toh work karna chahiye na because mera backend active (npm run dev)?
08/06/2024, 16:40 - +91 84476 93183: Baaki I'll give deploying the backend a shot.

08/06/2024, 17:06 - +91 84476 93183: haan
08/06/2024, 17:16 - +91 88829 29741: toh after deployment request is sent to "project-name.vercel.app/api/user/login"
08/06/2024, 17:16 - +91 88829 29741: and even if the local backend is up and running, how will the frontend know ? <This message was edited>

12/06/2024, 21:29 - +91 88829 29741: If in mongoDB, I have an array as a value which consists of different objects (not other document references), then will the objects in the array have an individual _id ?

I had initially referenced the objects in the array to a schema for which model wasn't made but then I thought it would take unnecessary space and so I decided to go with simpler objects (key and value written in the main schema). when I tested the api, it was still giving me _id so I thought maybe it was next cache or maybe MongoDB didn't updated schema, so I tried everything like restarting server, dropping document entirely but I still get the _id. 
any explanation or solution ?
12/06/2024, 22:56 - +91 96431 58960: by default it create _id for all the objects you can use {_id:false} in the child schema to prevent it

24/10/2024, 17:55 - +91 96229 70058: Devweek's whole purpose is to introduce the freshers to different techs like web, app, ml etc as well as teach some basics. This helps them choose what tech they want to learn. For example we conducted web dev session 2 days ago and it's already showing results as a fresher made their first attempt to make a simple website. This is what our goal is, to introduce them to tech and get them started.
We would love for you all (second years) to join devweek as well even though it was already conducted for your batch last year. The reason we didn't conduct it again is that most of you are already familiar with different tech fields and are exploring your interests.
If you'd still like to join our sessions contact @918929661506

08/07/2025, 16:33 - +91 91558 18401: I tried the internet but it gave me many ways to do it without context
08/07/2025, 16:40 - +91 88267 14515: well easiest way would be to just use some openAi api and get the data, but that isn't very efficient you could try using MCP if you only want to get the details about a pduct using product_id
08/07/2025, 18:30 - +91 98716 72999: Ig one really bad way would be to fuzzy find for smth looking like an order id in the query string,  querying that id on the database, and then passing on the query to the Chat bot with the contextüíÄ
08/07/2025, 19:02 - Srijan: A simple regex could fix the fuzzy find, assuming the data is correct
08/07/2025, 19:05 - +91 98716 72999: Yeah smh like that
08/07/2025, 19:05 - +91 98716 72999: I was thinking a special string which is in every order id in encrypted format
08/07/2025, 19:05 - +91 98716 72999: So that the server can decrypt the id and check for the special string
